      <description>For a project, it is not possible to write all the code yourself.
So it involves bringing in other people&amp;rsquo;s code and effectively avoiding duplicating the wheel, which is also called package introduction in Go.
After the birth of the Go language, there has been no official package management tool for many upgrades.
It was only in version 1.11 that go module, the official management tool, appeared.
So now most of the new Go projects are using go module for package management.</description>
